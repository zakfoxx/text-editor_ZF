I created a program that allows the user to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
so that the user can reliably retrieve them for later use

Created a text editor web application so that when the user opens the application in editor they will see a client-server folder structure
When the user runs `npm start` from the root directory, they will find that the application should start up from the back end and serve the client.
When the user runs text editor application from their terminal, they will find that JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
When the user runs webpack plugins, they will find the generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
When the user uses next-gen JavaScript in the application, they will find that the text editor still functions in the browser without error
When the user opens the text editor, the user will find that IndexedDB has immediately created a db storage
